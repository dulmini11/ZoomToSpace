      <h2>About Space</h2>
      <p>
  Space is a vast, boundless, three-dimensional expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere, starting around 100 kilometers (62 miles) above sea level at the Kármán line, where the atmosphere becomes too thin for conventional flight. Though it may appear empty, space is not a true vacuum. It is filled with cosmic phenomena such as radiation, dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational forces that influence the movement of matter and light throughout the universe.

  Space has no breathable air, no weather, and no atmosphere to scatter light, which is why the sky appears pitch black beyond Earth. However, the absence of an atmosphere allows for clearer views of distant celestial objects. Gravity still exists in space but weakens with distance from massive bodies like planets and stars, allowing objects to orbit one another.

  The distances in space are unimaginably large. Light from some galaxies takes billions of years to reach Earth, so when we observe them, we are actually looking back in time. The observable universe spans about 93 billion light-years, but it is believed to be only a small part of the full cosmos.

  Space contains a wide range of extreme and exotic objects. Black holes are regions where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, making them invisible to direct observation. Neutron stars are the dense remnants of supernova explosions, with a cubic centimeter weighing around 400 million tons. Pulsars, another form of neutron star, emit beams of radiation as they spin rapidly.

  Quasars are incredibly bright and distant objects powered by supermassive black holes. Supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars, release vast amounts of energy and distribute elements needed for the formation of new stars and planets. These cosmic events shape galaxies and the overall structure of the universe.

  By studying space, scientists uncover important knowledge about the universe’s origins, its composition, and the fundamental laws of physics—like gravity, relativity, and quantum mechanics. Space continues to challenge and expand human understanding of time, matter, and energy.

      <h3>What is Outer Space?</h3>
      <p>
        Outer space begins at the Kármán line — 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) above sea level. From that point, the atmosphere becomes too thin to support conventional flight or scatter light. In space, the blue sky fades into darkness.
      </p>

      <h3>Is Space Empty?</h3>
      <p>
        While space might seem empty, it’s not. It contains tiny particles of gas and dust, radiation, magnetic fields, and energy. Some areas are dense with stars and galaxies, while others are more isolated. It's also where mysterious substances like dark matter and dark energy reside.
      </p>

      <h3>The Structure of Outer Space</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geospace:</strong> Near-Earth space, affected by Earth's magnetic field.</li>
        <li><strong>Interplanetary Space:</strong> Within our Solar System, shaped by solar wind and the heliosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>Interstellar Space:</strong> Space between stars in a galaxy, filled with gas and dust.</li>
        <li><strong>Intergalactic Space:</strong> The vast space between galaxies, nearly a perfect vacuum.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is Space Made Of?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Normal Matter:</strong> The visible stuff — stars, planets, humans — but only ~5% of the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>Dark Matter:</strong> Invisible matter that doesn’t emit or absorb light, but has gravity (~27%).</li>
        <li><strong>Dark Energy:</strong> A mysterious force that causes the universe to expand faster (~68%).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Big is Space?</h3>
      <p>
        The observable universe spans about 93 billion light-years across. One light-year is nearly 9.3 trillion kilometers. Space continues to expand, and we still don’t know its full size. Some scientists even suggest there may be multiple universes.
      </p>

      <h3>Fascinating Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sound cannot travel in space.</li>
        <li>Space has no atmosphere or oxygen.</li>
        <li>Temperatures can vary from extreme heat to freezing cold.</li>
        <li>Stars, galaxies, black holes, and comets all exist in space.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>History of Space Exploration</h3>
        <p>
        The journey into space began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union, the first artificial satellite. Since then, humanity has achieved milestones like the Moon landing in 1969, Mars rover missions, and the development of the International Space Station.
        </p>
        <h3>The Future of Space Travel</h3>
        <p>
        Companies like SpaceX and NASA aim to send humans to Mars. Innovations like reusable rockets, space tourism, and colonization of other planets could soon become reality. AI, robotics, and advanced propulsion systems are shaping this future.
